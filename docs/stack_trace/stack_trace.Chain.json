{"name":"Chain","qualifiedName":"stack_trace/stack_trace.Chain","comment":"<p>A chain of stack traces.</p>\n<p>A stack chain is a collection of one or more stack traces that collectively\nrepresent the path from main through nested function calls to a particular\ncode location, usually where an error was thrown. Multiple stack traces are\nnecessary when using asynchronous functions, since the program's stack is\nreset before each asynchronous callback is run.</p>\n<p>Stack chains can be automatically tracked using <a>stack_trace/stack_trace.Chain.capture</a>. This sets\nup a new <a>stack_trace/dart-async.Zone</a> in which the current stack chain is tracked and can be\naccessed using new Chain.current. Any errors that would be top-leveled in\nthe zone can be handled, along with their associated chains, with the\n<code>onError</code> callback. For example:</p>\n<pre><code>Chain.capture(() {\n  // ...\n}, onError: (error, stackChain) {\n  print(\"Caught error $error\\n\"\n        \"$stackChain\");\n});\n</code></pre>\n<p>For the most part <a>stack_trace/stack_trace.Chain.capture</a> will notice when an error is thrown and\nassociate the correct stack chain with it; the chain can be accessed using\nnew Chain.forTrace.
