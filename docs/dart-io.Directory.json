{"name":"Directory","qualifiedName":"dart-io.Directory","comment":"<p>A reference to a directory (or <em>folder</em>) on the file system.</p>\n<p>A Directory instance is an object holding a <a>dart-io.Directory.path</a> on which operations can\nbe performed. The path to the directory can be <a>dart-io.Directory.absolute</a> or relative.\nYou can get the parent directory using the getter <a>dart-io.FileSystemEntity.parent</a>,\na property inherited from <a>dart-io.FileSystemEntity</a>.</p>\n<p>In addition to being used as an instance to access the file system,\nDirectory has a number of static properties, such as <a>dart-io.Directory.systemTemp</a>,\nwhich gets the system's temporary directory, and the getter and setter\n<a>dart-io.Directory.current</a>, which you can use to access or change the current directory.</p>\n<p>Create a new Directory object with a pathname to access the specified\ndirectory on the file system from your program.</p>\n<pre><code>var myDir = new Directory('myDir');\n</code></pre>\n<p>Most methods in this class occur in synchronous and asynchronous pairs,\nfor example, <a>dart-io.Directory.create</a> and <a>dart-io.Directory.createSync</a>.\nUnless you have a specific reason for using the synchronous version\nof a method, prefer the asynchronous version to avoid blocking your program.</p>\n<h2>Create a directory</h2>\n<p>The following code sample creates a directory using the <a>dart-io.Directory.create</a> method.\nBy setting the <code>recursive</code> parameter to true, you can create the\nnamed directory and all its necessary parent directories,\nif they do not already exist.</p>\n<pre><code>import 'dart:io';\n\nvoid main() {\n  // Creates dir/ and dir/subdir/.\n  new Directory('dir/subdir').create(recursive: true)\n    // The created directory is returned as a Future.\n    .then((Directory directory) {\n      print(directory.path);\n  });\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h2>List a directory</h2>\n<p>Use the <a>dart-io.Directory.list</a> or <a>dart-io.Directory.listSync</a> methods to get the files and directories\ncontained by a directory.\nSet <code>recursive</code> to true to recursively list all subdirectories.\nSet <code>followLinks</code> to true to follow symbolic links.\nThe list method returns a <a>dart-async.Stream</a> that provides FileSystemEntity\nobjects. Use the listen callback function to process each object\nas it become available.</p>\n<pre><code>import 'dart:io';\n\nvoid main() {\n  // Get the system temp directory.\n  var systemTempDir = Directory.systemTemp;\n\n  // List directory contents, recursing into sub-directories,\n  // but not following symbolic links.\n  systemTempDir.list(recursive: true, followLinks: false)\n    .listen((FileSystemEntity entity) {\n      print(entity.path);\n    });\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h2>The use of Futures</h2>\n<p>I/O operations can block a program for some period of time while it waits for\nthe operation to complete. To avoid this, all\nmethods involving I/O have an asynchronous variant which returns a <a>dart-async.Future</a>.\nThis future completes when the I/O operation finishes. While the I/O\noperation is in progress, the Dart program is not blocked,\nand can perform other operations.</p>\n<p>For example,\nthe <a>dart-io.FileSystemEntity.exists</a> method, which determines whether the directory exists,\nreturns a boolean value using a Future.\nUse <code>then</code> to register a callback function, which is called when\nthe value is ready.</p>\n<pre><code>import 'dart:io';\n\nmain() {\n  final myDir = new Directory('dir');\n  myDir.exists().then((isThere) {\n    isThere ? print('exists') : print('non-existent');\n  });\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>In addition to exists, the <a>dart-io.FileSystemEntity.stat</a>, <a>dart-io.Directory.rename</a>, and\nother methods, return Futures.</p>\n<h2>Other resources</h2><ul><li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.dartlang.org/dart-by-example/#files-directories-and-symlinks\">Dart by Example</a>\nprovides additional task-oriented code samples that show how to use \nvarious API from the Directory class and the related <a>dart-io.File</a> class.</p></li><li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.dartlang.org/docs/dart-up-and-running/contents/ch03.html#ch03-dartio---file-and-socket-io-for-command-line-apps\">I/O for Command-Line Apps</a>\na section from <em>A Tour of the Dart Libraries</em>\ncovers files and directories.</p></li><li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.dartlang.org/docs/tutorials/cmdline/\">Write Command-Line Apps</a>,\na tutorial about writing command-line apps, includes information\nabout files and directories.</p></li></ul>","isAbstract":true,"superclass":"dart-io.FileSystemEntity","implements":[],"subclass":[],"variables":{"path":{"name":"path","qualifiedName":"dart-io.Directory.path","comment":"<p>Gets the path of this directory.</p>","final":true,"static":false,"constant":false,"type":[{"outer":"dart-core.String","inner":[]}],"annotations":[]}},"inheritedVariables":{},"methods":{"setters":{"current=":{"name":"current=","qualifiedName":"dart-io.Directory.current=","comment":"<p>Sets the current working directory of the Dart process including\nall running isolates.
