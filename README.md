# math_expressions

A library for parsing and evaluating mathematical expressions.

* Performs evaluations in real, vector, and [interval][bohlender2010] contexts.
* Supports expression simplification and differentiation.

math_expressions is inspired by [mathExpr][] for Java and distributed under the
[MIT license][LICENSE].

## Features

* Evaluation of expressions in various modes: Real, Vector and [Interval][bohlender2010].
* Parsing, simplification and differentiation of mathematical expressions.
* Supporting most [basic math functions][defaultFunctions] out of the box.
* Extensible through custom function definitions in code.
* Well [documented][dartdoc] and tested.

This package contains a very simple [command-line interpreter](bin/interpreter.dart)
for real numbers:

    dart pub run math_expressions:interpreter

### What's not working yet?

* Some evaluations in vector and interval space (especially functions).
* N-dimensional vectors. Curently no more than four dimensions are supported.
* The parser only works for real numbers.
* Complex numbers.

Suggestions and pull requests are always welcome!

## Usage

Below are two basic examples of how to use this library. There also is some [additional example code](example/main.dart) available.

### 1. Expression creation and evaluation

This example shows how to evaluate

$\frac{(x^2+\cos y)}{3}$


for $x=2, y=\pi$

#### Build the expression

You can either create an mathematical expression programmatically or parse a string.

* Create the expression programmatically:
```dart
  Variable x = Variable('x'), y = Variable('y');
  Power xSquare = Power(x, 2);
  Cos yCos = Cos(y);
  Number three = Number(3.0);
  Expression exp = (xSquare + yCos) / three;
```

* Create the expression via the parser:
```dart
  Parser p = Parser();
  Expression exp = p.parse("(x^2 + cos(y)) / 3");
```

#### Evaluate the expression

* Bind variables and evaluate the expression as real number:
```dart
  // Bind variables:
  ContextModel cm = ContextModel();
  cm.bindVariable(x, Number(2.0));
  cm.bindVariable(y, Number(Math.PI));

  // Evaluate expression:
  double eval = exp.evaluate(EvaluationType.REAL, cm);

  print(eval) // = 1.0
```

### 2. Expression simplification and differentiation

This example shows how to simplify and differentiate

$x \cdot 1 - (-5)$

* Expressions can be simplified and differentiated with respect to a given variable:
```dart
  Expression exp = p.parse("x*1 - (-5)");

  print(exp);            // = ((x * 1.0) - -(5.0))
  print(exp.simplify()); // = (x + 5.0)

  Expression expDerived = exp.derive('x');

  print(expDerived);            // = (((x * 0.0) + (1.0 * 1.0)) - -(0.0))
  print(expDerived.simplify()); // = 1.0
```

## Alternatives

Here are some other Dart libraries that implement similar functionality to
math_expression: parsing and evaluating mathematical expressions.

* [expressions][]: an elegant and small library to parse and evaluate simple
  expressions.
* [function_tree][]: a library for parsing, evaluating and plotting single- and
  multi-variables numerical functions.

To the author's knowledge math_expressions is currently the only library
supporting interval arithmetics.
